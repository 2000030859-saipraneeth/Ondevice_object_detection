# TensorFlow Lite YOLOv4 Object Detection

This project demonstrates the use of a YOLOv4 model trained on the following classes:

- People
- Animals
- Vehicles
- Furniture
- Electronics
- Sports_equipment
- Kitchen_Appliances
- Clothing
- Food
- Tools
- Office_Supplies
- Toys
- Musical_instruments
- Beauty_products
- Home_Decor

The model was trained on a dataset of size 527 MB and has a model size of 247 MB. The inference time is approximately 12 ms when using a GPU, specifically an NVIDIA RTS 3060.
